<h1>LA 558 Exercise<br> </h1>

<p>Welcome to my page. My name is Yu Tian, and you can call me Tia just in case that you will be confused with the pronuniciation of my first name Yu with the pronoun You.</p>
 <p>I was a transfer student from China which meant that I finished my first two years bachelor program in China and then Tranferred to Iowa State to accomplished rest of the program and my major was civil engineering. After graduation, I continue graduate school in Iowa State. Right now, I am a second year master student under Dr. Peter Savolainen majoring in transportation engineering.</p>
   <p>I will graduate in fall 2018. I choose this course and on the path to get the GIS certification.So far, I think this course is pretty cool because I can learn many new things.</p> 
  <p>For the past winter vacation, I should have some highlights that my friend and I planned to go to New York before we went to Washington D.C. for confrence. Because of snowstorm, the flights kept cancelling so that we had to cancel the whole trip which made me so sad. But I still have happy news that my parents will come to Ames all the way from China and stay with me to celebrate Chinese Spring Festival. I am counting down the days I can meet them and I want to give them a big hug because I miss them soooo much!</p>
