  <h3>Assignment 20</h3>
  <p>After watching the lecture video, the lecture mainly introduce the Mapbox, and give us a overview on how to use Mapbox as well as an example to show how to style your map.</p>
  <p>If I use Mapbox to do my assignment, I am going to use the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">'Navigation Preview Day' </span>map template. It contains all transportaion systems all over the world, besides, it also have many many useful reference layers, such as city/county boundaries. In a word, this map have street, terrain, traffic characteristics with total 202 layers available.</P>
  <p>The main purpose for my map is to show the groud transport system for people getting to their destination, either go to recreational places nearby, or hospital and airports around. </P>
    <p>On my map, I will choose to show city names, and state names. As zoom in, the hospital locations as well as airport locations will graduately show up. Same for traffic, but I will exclude bridge trafiic and ferry trffic, and other traffic related with non-ground. I will arrage the color as well as the stop points, show the streets with labels, railway with labels. Also, I will show the parks and other main recreation places on my map. </P>
<p>Also, I will design different maps using Mapbox to show single feature on individual maps. Those maps will be defined as overlayer add to my base map. Using control layers to let user to access single fearture layer. In this case, user can have a clear view and better understand on these features.</P>
<p>Overall, Mapbox is a very good and convenient tool to create your own maps. After designing the map, you can choose publish the map and get the url. Then you can use the url it generates copy and paste in your code. It looks pretty cool you can use the map you create with all features you want as your Tilelayer.</P>
