    <br><pr>I went to San Francisco with my friend in May last year, and I was really enjoy this trip.We stayed there for 5 days and every day I could see a different San Francisco.</pr></br>
    <br><pr>As an engineering major student, Golden Gate Bridge was the one we definitely would go. We chose walked from the side to side to take a look at the structure of the bridge as well as the side view of city layout. </pr>

<br><pr>We also took a ferry on the ocean when sun set, and the view was amazing. The buildings along the skyline were lighted up together with the music on ferry. All I saw was like a picture. </pr>

<br> <pr>Of course, we went to Lombard Street, took the city little train. Also, we went to Chinatown to have a lot delicious food. Overall, this trip would become one of my best memories.</pr></br>
